# Grade Tests

Grade a curated list of test methods and produce a compact, PR-comment-friendly
report: one row per test method with a letter grade, a score band, and a
one-line note explaining the grade. The skill **does not discover tests on its
own** — the caller (typically a PR automation workflow or a human reviewer
holding a specific list) provides the test methods to grade.

## Why a Per-Test Grade

Suite-wide audits (`test-anti-patterns`, `assertion-quality`,
`test-smell-detection`) produce excellent diagnostic reports, but they are
hard to consume as a short PR comment. Reviewers of a PR mostly want to know:
*for the tests this PR adds or changes, are they good?* This skill answers
that question with a one-row-per-test verdict that fits in a comment table.

## When to Use

- A PR automation workflow needs to post a comment grading the tests
  introduced or modified in a pull request.
- A reviewer has a specific list of tests (a file, a class, a method list,
  or a diff hunk) and wants a per-test verdict rather than a suite report.
- A maintainer wants to triage which of N tests in a contribution deserve
  follow-up improvements.

## When Not to Use

- The caller wants a full suite audit or comparative metrics — use
  `test-anti-patterns` (pragmatic) or `test-smell-detection` (formal) and
  let the `test-quality-auditor` agent orchestrate.
- The caller wants to *write* new tests — use `code-testing-generator`
  (any language) or `writing-mstest-tests` (MSTest specifically).
- The caller wants to measure code coverage or CRAP scores — use
  `coverage-analysis` or `crap-score` (.NET only).
- The caller wants to fix issues directly in test code — invoke the
  appropriate editing skill.
- No specific list of tests is provided. Do **not** try to grade every test
  in the workspace; ask the caller for an explicit list or scope.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Test methods | Yes | A scope to grade. Provide one of: (a) an explicit list of test method names (fully-qualified, e.g. `Namespace.ClassName.TestMethodName`); (b) one or more file paths plus an explicit instruction to grade every test declared in those files; or (c) a diff hunk / PR identifier whose changed tests should be graded. File paths are recommended but optional when method names are unambiguous in the workspace. Ambiguous requests like *"grade my tests"* with no scope are rejected up-front (see Step 0); this skill is for curated input and does not auto-grade an entire workspace. |
| Test bodies / spans | Recommended | The exact source lines for each test method. If omitted, read them from the listed files. |
| Production code | No | The code under test, for judging whether assertions cover the meaningful behaviors. When unavailable, mark relevant findings as "Unverified" rather than guessing. |
| Diff context | No | When grading PR changes, the unified diff for each test method helps focus on what actually changed. |

### Step 0: Validate the input

Before doing anything else, check that the caller provided one of:

1. An explicit list of test method names, **or**
2. One or more file paths plus an explicit instruction to grade every test
   declared in those files (e.g., "grade every test in `OrderTests.cs`"), **or**
3. A diff hunk or PR identifier whose changed tests should be graded.

If the request is ambiguous (e.g., *"Grade my tests"*, *"Are these tests
any good?"* with no scope, *"Review the test suite"*), **do not load
extensions, do not read files, and do not grade anything**. Reply with a
short message asking the caller to provide an explicit list / file(s) /
diff, and optionally point them at `test-quality-auditor` agent or
`test-anti-patterns` skill for full-suite analysis. Stop there.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect language and load extension

Identify the target codebase's language and test framework from the file
extensions and the test method markers in the provided list. Call the
`test-analysis-extensions` skill and read the matching extension file (e.g.,
`extensions/dotnet.md` for MSTest/xUnit/NUnit/TUnit, `extensions/python.md`
for pytest, `extensions/typescript.md` for Jest/Vitest, `extensions/go.md`
for the standard `testing` package). If the input contains tests from
multiple languages, load each relevant extension and grade each test using
its language's conventions.

### Step 2: Resolve the test bodies

For each entry in the input list:

1. If the test body is provided inline, use it directly.
2. Otherwise read the file at the given path and locate the method by its
   fully-qualified name. Capture the full method body, including attributes
   / decorators / fixtures and any helper code that the test calls.
3. If a method cannot be found, record it as `N/A — method not found` and
   continue. Never invent a body to grade.

### Step 3: Score each test

Start every test at grade **A (score band 90–100)**, then apply deductions
strictly for **observable issues** in the captured body. Do **not** deduct
for hypothetical concerns (e.g., "could have more negative assertions")
unless the production code clearly demands them and the production code is
available.

#### Three sub-dimensions

Compute three sub-grades (each A–F) that together drive the overall grade.

##### A. Assertion strength

Read the loaded language extension's assertion API list and classify every
assertion in the test body. Score from highest to lowest:

| Sub-grade | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| **A** | At least one meaningful value assertion (equality / structural / exception / state) plus, where appropriate, additional checks (negative, type, collection contents). Mock-call verifications (`Verify`, `toHaveBeenCalledWith`, `Should -Invoke`) and bare assertion forms (pytest `assert`, Go `if got != want { t.Errorf(...) }`, Rust `assert!()`) count as real assertions. |
| **B** | One clear meaningful assertion that verifies the behavior under test. |
| **C** | Only trivial assertions (single `IsNotNull` / `toBeDefined` / `assert x is not None`), or assertions that check a single field while the operation produces a richer result. |
| **D** | One self-referential / tautological assertion (`Assert.AreEqual(x, x)`, `assert dto.name == dto.name`, round-trip identity without a non-trivial input), or broad exception assertions (`Assert.ThrowsException<Exception>`). |
| **F** | No assertions at all; **all** assertions are always-true literals (`Assert.IsTrue(true)`, `assert True`, `expect(true).toBe(true)`) — these verify nothing and are equivalent to having no assertions; or all assertions are silently un-awaited (e.g., `expect(promise).resolves.toBe(x)` without `await`/`return`, async TUnit/xUnit `Assert.ThrowsAsync` without `await`, pytest-asyncio with un-awaited coroutine). |

Exception tests (`Assert.ThrowsException<T>`, `pytest.raises`, `expect(fn).toThrow`,
`assertThrows`, `#[should_panic]`, `Should -Throw`, `EXPECT_THROW`) are
complete on their own — do not require additional assertions.

##### B. Structure & focus

| Sub-grade | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| **A** | Clear Arrange-Act-Assert (or Given-When-Then) separation. Single behavior under test. Body under ~30 lines. Setup uses framework conventions. |
| **B** | One mild structural issue (slightly long body, missing blank lines between phases) but intent is clear. |
| **C** | Multiple behaviors mixed in one test, or AAA phases interleaved enough to slow comprehension. |
| **D** | Conditional logic in the test (`if`/`switch` driving assertions) — except for idiomatic Go/Rust table-driven sub-test loops; or test relies on previous test state (ordering dependency). |
| **F** | Test exceeds ~60 lines and verifies multiple unrelated behaviors; or shares mutable state with other tests through statics/globals without reset. |

##### C. Anti-pattern hygiene

Scan against the catalog below. The Anti-pattern sub-grade is computed
in two passes and combined deterministically:

1. **Hard ceiling pass.** Every **Critical** or **High** finding sets a
   maximum sub-grade (F, D, or C as labeled). Take the **worst** ceiling
   across all matched Critical/High findings — these do not accumulate
   (a single F finding caps the sub-grade at F regardless of how many
   other Critical/High findings are present).
2. **Medium-deduction pass.** Start from **A**, then for each **Medium**
   finding deduct one sub-grade level (A→B, B→C, C→D, D→F). These do
   accumulate across findings.

The final Anti-pattern sub-grade is the **worse** of the two passes
(i.e., `min(hard_ceiling, A − medium_count)`). **Low** findings never
affect the grade — mention them in the note only.

Examples (Critical/High and Medium counts → Anti-pattern sub-grade):

- Zero Critical/High, 1 Medium → **B** (A − 1)
- Zero Critical/High, 3 Medium → **D** (A − 3)
- One C-ceiling (e.g., over-mocking), 0 Medium → **C**
- One C-ceiling, 2 Medium → **D** (`min(C, A − 2 = C) = C`, but a third Medium would tip to **D**)
- One F-finding (e.g., swallowed exception) plus any number of Medium → **F**

**Critical (drop straight to F or D)**

- No assertions at all → F (also drives Assertion sub-grade to F)
- Swallowed exceptions: `try { … } catch { }` (.NET), bare `except: pass`
  (Python), `try { … } catch (e) {}` (JS/TS/Java), `defer recover()`
  without re-panic (Go), `rescue StandardError` with no assertion (Ruby),
  empty `catch` (Kotlin/Swift) → F
- Assert-in-catch pattern (`Assert.Fail(ex.Message)` instead of
  `Assert.ThrowsException`) → D
- Always-true literal assertions (`Assert.IsTrue(true)`, `assert True`,
  `expect(true).toBe(true)`) → **F** (verifies nothing; also drives
  Assertion sub-grade to F)
- Self-referential / tautological assertions on bound values
  (`Assert.AreEqual(x, x)`, `assert dto.name == dto.name`) → D
- Commented-out assertions → D

**High (drop one or two sub-grades)**

- Wall-clock sleep used for synchronization: `Thread.Sleep`, `Task.Delay`,
  `time.sleep`, `setTimeout`-based wait, `Thread.sleep`, `time.Sleep`,
  `sleep`, `std::thread::sleep`, `Start-Sleep`,
  `std::this_thread::sleep_for` (in a unit test) → D
- Unseeded randomness, wall-clock reads without abstraction
  (`DateTime.Now`, `datetime.now()`, `Date.now()`,
  `System.currentTimeMillis()`, `time.Now()`, `Time.now`,
  `Instant::now()`, `Get-Date`, `system_clock::now`) → D
- Hard-coded environment-dependent paths (`C:\…`, `/tmp/…`, network hosts) → D
- Ordering dependency on mutable static / package globals → D
- Broad exception assertion (`Assert.ThrowsException<Exception>`,
  `pytest.raises(Exception)`, `expect(fn).toThrow(Error)` without matcher,
  `#[should_panic]` without `expected = "…"`, `Should -Throw` without
  `-ExpectedMessage`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`) → C
- Over-mocking: more mock setup lines than test logic, or verifying exact
  call sequences instead of outcomes → C
- Implementation coupling: reflection on private members, casting to
  internal types to access state → C

**Medium (drop one sub-grade)**

- Poor name: `Test1`, `TestMethod`, `test`, single-word name that says
  nothing about scenario or expected outcome (judge against the language
  extension's convention) → drop one sub-grade
- Magic values: unexplained `42`, `"foo"`, `0x1234` in arrange/assert
  without naming or comment → drop one sub-grade
- Giant test (>30 lines covering a single behavior) → drop one sub-grade
- Assertion messages that just repeat the assertion text → drop one sub-grade
- Missing AAA / GWT separation when the test is non-trivial → drop one sub-grade

**Low (note only, no deduction)**

- Unused setup/teardown hooks; print debugging left in (`Console.WriteLine`,
  `print`, `console.log`, `System.out.println`, `fmt.Println`, `puts`,
  `dbg!`, `Write-Host`, `std::cout`); inconsistent naming versus siblings;
  leftover TODO comments. Mention in the note column but do not deduct.

#### Combining sub-grades

Convert sub-grades to numeric points: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.
- **Overall score band** = weighted average:
  `0.45 × Assertion + 0.30 × Anti-pattern + 0.25 × Structure`
- Map to letter:
  - ≥ 3.5 → **A** (band 90–100)
  - ≥ 2.8 → **B** (band 80–89)
  - ≥ 2.0 → **C** (band 70–79)
  - ≥ 1.2 → **D** (band 60–69)
  - < 1.2 → **F** (band 0–59)
- The overall grade is **capped at the worst sub-grade** — if any sub-grade
  is **F**, the overall grade is **F**; if the worst sub-grade is **D**,
  the overall grade is at most **D**; and so on. A test that fails on any
  one dimension cannot earn a higher overall grade than that dimension.

Report the **letter grade** and the **score band** (not a single 0–100
number). False precision invites bikeshedding; bands keep the conversation
focused on the rubric.

### Step 4: Build the note

The note column is one short sentence (target ≤ 120 characters). State the
single most important reason for the grade. Examples:

- A (90–100): `Clear AAA structure; equality + exception assertions on the public contract.`
- B (80–89): `Good assertion variety, mildly long body — consider splitting into per-condition tests.`
- C (70–79): `Only checks IsNotNull on the result; no value verification.`
- D (60–69): `Self-referential assertion: round-trip identity verifies plumbing, not transformation.`
- F (0–59): `No assertions — test executes the method but never verifies anything.`

If a test gets A with no notable issues, the note may simply be
`No issues found.` — do not invent weaknesses to justify the grade.

### Step 5: Report

Produce two sections.

#### 1. Summary

A short paragraph (2–4 sentences) covering: total tests graded, grade
distribution, most common issue, and the single most important
recommendation.

#### 2. Per-test table

```markdown
| Test | Grade | Band | Notes |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| `Namespace.ClassName.Test_Method_Condition_Expected` | A | 90–100 | Clear AAA; equality + exception assertions. |
| `Namespace.ClassName.Test_Other` | C | 70–79 | Only `IsNotNull` — no value verification. |
| `Namespace.ClassName.Test_Old` | F | 0–59 | No assertions. |
```

**Caps and ordering**:
- If the table would exceed **50 rows**, show all tests graded below **B**
  first (worst to best), then a sample of the best tests, and wrap any
  overflow in a collapsed `<details>` block.
- Within the same grade, order by file path then by method name for
  determinism.
- If the diff context is provided, prefix each test name with a `(new)` or
  `(modified)` marker.

If multiple languages are present, produce one table per language and
prefix each section with the language name and framework.

## Validation

- [ ] Every test in the input list appears in the table (or is recorded as
      `N/A — method not found`).
- [ ] Every grade is justified by at least one observable signal in the
      captured body — no speculative deductions.
- [ ] Trivial-assertion tests are flagged only when the **only** assertion
      is trivial (a null check before a meaningful assertion is not trivial).
- [ ] Exception-only tests are not penalized for low assertion count.
- [ ] Mock-call verifications and bare assertion forms count as real
      assertions of the appropriate category.
- [ ] Boolean assertions on meaningful properties (`Assert.IsTrue(result.IsValid)`)
      are not classified as always-true; only literal `true`/`false` constants are.
- [ ] Self-referential assertions are flagged separately from normal
      equality assertions.
- [ ] Idiomatic patterns are not flagged: Go/Rust table-driven sub-tests,
      pytest bare `assert`, Go `if got != want { t.Errorf(...) }`,
      JS/TS `expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...)`.
- [ ] Async test pitfalls (un-awaited `resolves`/`rejects`/`ThrowsAsync`,
      pytest-asyncio without `await`) drop the Assertion sub-grade to F.
- [ ] The summary leads with the highest-leverage observation, not a recap
      of the table.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Grading every test in the workspace when no list is provided | Ask the caller for the explicit list; this skill is for curated input. |
| Inflating deductions to justify the grade | Start at A; deduct only for observable issues. |
| Penalizing exception tests for low assertion count | Exception assertions are complete on their own. |
| Treating `IsNotNull` before a value assertion as trivial | Only flag when the null check is the **only** assertion. |
| Treating any Boolean assertion as effectively assertion-free | Only always-true literals (`Assert.IsTrue(true)`, `assert True`) are; meaningful `Assert.IsTrue(result.IsValid)` is a real assertion. |
| Flagging Go/Rust table-driven loops as conditional logic | They are idiomatic; do not deduct. |
| Treating pytest bare `assert` or Go `if got != want { t.Error… }` as missing-framework | Both are canonical; count in the correct assertion category. |
| Penalizing tests when production code is unavailable | Mark concerns about uncovered behaviors as `Unverified` and do not deduct. |
| Using a fake-precise score (e.g., 87/100) | Use the score band only — 90–100, 80–89, 70–79, 60–69, 0–59. |
| Spilling a 500-row table into a PR comment | Apply the row cap from Step 5; collapse extras into `<details>`. |
| Re-reporting an existing finding three times under different categories | Pick the most fitting category and report once. |
| Inventing weaknesses for A-grade tests to make the note "balanced" | If a test is clean, the note may simply read `No issues found.` |
