# Microsoft.Testing.Platform

Microsoft.Testing.Platform is a lightweight and portable alternative to [VSTest](https://github.com/microsoft/vstest) for running tests in CLI, continuous integration (CI) pipelines, Visual Studio Test Explorer, and Visual Studio Code Test Explorer. Microsoft.Testing.Platform is embedded directly in your test projects and test applications can be run directly.

Microsoft.Testing.Platform is open source. You can find `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` code in the [microsoft/testfx](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/tree/main/src/Platform/Microsoft.Testing.Platform) GitHub repository.

## Install the package

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Testing.Platform
```

## About

This package provides the core platform and the .NET implementation of the testing protocol. It includes:

- **Test application host**: test projects are built as executables that can be run directly
- **Extensibility model**: a rich extensibility model allowing test frameworks, tools and extensions to interoperate
- **Protocol**: the `.NET Testing Protocol` enabling communication between the test host and external consumers (e.g. IDE, CI)

This package is typically **not referenced directly**. Instead, test framework packages (such as [MSTest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSTest)) reference it automatically.
