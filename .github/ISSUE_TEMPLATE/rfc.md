# RFC NNN - (Fill me in with a feature name)

- [ ] Approved in principle
- [ ] Under discussion
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Shipped

## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar
with testing to understand, and for somebody familiar with MSTest to implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Compatibility

Is this a breaking change?

### Unresolved questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
