description: >-
  When the Azure Pipelines PR build (`microsoft.testfx`) fails, downloads the binary
  logs that build already produced — it does NOT rebuild — and delegates to
  the `build-failure-analyst` agent, which queries the binlogs live via the
  containerized `binlog-mcp` MCP server to identify root causes, post a PR
  comment summarizing them, and attach inline `suggestion` blocks tied to the
  diff.

# This workflow is **advisory**, not gating, and it performs **no build of its
# own**. testfx's authoritative PR build runs on Azure DevOps
# (dnceng-public/public, pipeline "microsoft.testfx", definitionId 209) and publishes
# each build leg's binary log as a `Logs_Build_<leg>` pipeline artifact. When
# that build's GitHub check reports failure, this workflow downloads the
# binlogs from **all** build legs (anonymously — dnceng-public/public is a
# public project) and the agent analyses whichever leg(s) actually contain
# errors. Reusing the binlogs avoids a duplicate build: the analysis pipeline
# only downloads build artifacts (data) and reads them — it does **not** build
# or execute PR code. (gh-aw's generated jobs may run `actions/checkout` —
# depending on the trigger — to fetch the repository for agent
# configuration/context; that is a checkout for tooling only, and no build or
# execution of the PR's code is performed.)

on:
  # `check_run` fires for every check on a commit, so the `fetch-binlog` job
  # below filters tightly to the `microsoft.testfx` build check reporting failure.

  # Advisory analysis should run for **every** failing PR — including external
  # contributors' PRs, which are the most likely to break the build. Disable
  # gh-aw's default author-association gate (which would otherwise skip
  # non-write-access actors, and on `check_run` the actor is the pipeline app
  # anyway). This is safe here: the workflow only reads a public binlog and
  # posts advisory comments — it never builds or executes PR code.
