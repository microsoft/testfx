# Unskip Closed Tests

Review the trusted manifest at `GH_AW_UNSKIP_MANIFEST` and load
`.github/agents/unskip-closed-tests.agent.md`.

The deterministic collector, not you, owns source identity and GitHub
eligibility. You may defer an eligible candidate when its source or issue
context remains ambiguous, but you must not invent or repair candidate IDs,
paths, spans, containing types, test FQNs, issue references, issue states, or
revision data.

When one or more manifest candidates are safe to attempt, call
`apply_verified_unskips` exactly once with:

- `manifest_digest` equal to `GH_AW_UNSKIP_MANIFEST_DIGEST`;
- `candidate_ids_json` containing a JSON array of unique candidate IDs copied
  exactly from the manifest.

The trusted read-only verification job revalidates the source, remote state,
proposed sites, edits, and structured test evidence, then a fresh publisher
checkout applies only the validated package before opening one draft pull
request. If no candidate should proceed, call `noop` once with a short reason.
