# RS0016: Only enable if API files are present
# This should NOT be in .editorconfig.
# .editorconfig is a per-file (syntax tree) concept.
# The public API analyzer will attempt to get the options for the **first tree**.
# The first tree could be a file outside of our repo (e.g, a source-only package like Polyfill)
# By having this option here in .globalconfig, we ensure it's picked up correctly regardless of what the first tree is.
# See comments in https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/pull/6230 for clarification.
